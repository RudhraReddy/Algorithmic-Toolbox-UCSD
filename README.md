# Algorithmic Toolbox [[Certificate]](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/P7UWAE5Z4NAJ?utm_medium=certificate&utm_source=link&utm_campaign=copybutton_certificate)
### About the Course
The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second).
